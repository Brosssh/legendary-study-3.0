# âœ¨ The Legendary Study âœ¨

This is the backend that collect EIDs from [Wasmegg](https://wasmegg-carpet.netlify.app/), process them and generate daily reports showing the legendary distribution over the playerbase. The reports are available on [Wasmegg Legendary Study](https://wasmegg-carpet.netlify.app/legendary-study/).  

## About EID security

I (Brosssh) can never see the EIDs that this application uses. Your clean EID will be only used to make API calls to the game server. After the API call, **your EID is [obfuscated and hashed](https://github.com/Brosssh/legendary-study-3.0/blob/main/backend/utility.py#L22) before being stored**. An hashed string cannot be reversed, but it can still be used to uniquely identify the same user.

## The cheaters issue

As we know, cheaters exists. **Cheaters that use well known techniques have been exlcuded.** However, there are numerous way of cheating, and only a few of them can be detected from just a single player backup. For this reason, **it is possible** that (some) cheaters are included in the study.  

## For the nerds

### How does this work?

Wasmegg send me the EIDs (of people who choose to join) via the [submitEID POST request](https://legendary-study-3-0.vercel.app/apidocs/#/default/post_submitEID). Only if I don't already have a recent backup (<1 hour ago), get a backup from Auxbrain server, process it and upload it to a MongoDB Cluster.

Every day, a GitHub Action triggers `calc_daily_reports.py`, which does queries to the cluster above and generate the report file, which is uploaded to another MongoDB Cluster.

### Swagger

I have created a [Swagger interface](https://legendary-study-3-0.vercel.app/apidocs/) for the API documentation.
